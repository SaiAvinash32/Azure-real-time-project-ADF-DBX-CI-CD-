pl_mysql_landing_to_bronze -> This pipeline loads data(.parquet files) into bronze layer table.

Implementation steps:
	1.loading_to_bronze: Trigger the databricks notebook which contains script to extract records from source file(in landing container) and insert those records in bronze layer table. If loading_to_bronze activity fails then go to step 2 otherwise go to step 3.
	2. Trigger bronze ingestion failure email alert and collect logs.
	3.Records Validation: Validate whether source files and records inserted in bronze layer tables are same or not. If validation fails go the step2, otherwise go to step 4.
	4. Collect logs for bronze layer ingestion success.
