pl_sftp_ingestion -> This pipeline ingests the data(.csv files) from external SFTP location to azure cloud(landing->bronze->silver->gold).

Implementation steps:
   1.Get Metadata details: Extract the relevant parameters from databricks metadata tables required to run adf pipeline.
   1.1 Trigger pipeline inprogress email alert and store pipeline start time in a variable.
   2.Get Source File details: Collects File names, file format from the SFTP source location.
   3.Check Source File count: Validate whether files are available in SFTP source location or not. If Source File count = 0, then go to step 4, otherwise go the step 5.
   4.Collect logs and trigger email alert and end the pipeline.
   5.Copy Source Files: Copy source files to landing container in azure ADLS gen2.
   6. Trigger sftp_landing_to_bronze pipeline.
   7.On completion of step 6, move files to processed folder in landing container.
   8. On Successful completion of step 7,Trigger bronze_to_silver pipeline.
   9. On successful completion of step 8, trigger silver_to_gold pipeline.
   10. On completion of step 9, trigger pipeline completion email alert(Success/Failure).
